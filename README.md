# About me

I am a small farm town community maths teacher trying to learn programming basics and how to integrate AI in my teaching.  
What basics?  
-Using linux as my daily driver.  
-Using python to understand coding / programming.  
-Using GitHub and / or Colab to consolidate all this learning.
  
What AI?  
-Grinding through some Google Training for Educators.  
-Testing fideltiy and veracity of maths solutions.  
  
I like long bike rides down the pacific coast, pretending I'm a rock god, roll / role playing games, and am a Constant Reader.
